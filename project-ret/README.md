This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Welcome to my project MUSIC APP

My Stack [`REACT, NEXT.js, Native MongoClient, anime.js, Redux`]

## About my app:  
    What is the purpose of the project?

        The application was mean as a pet project, as an approximate version of production, but there is a nuance in the form of storing audio files.
        To do this, you need to store in the cloud and link with the collection in mongo. During development, it came to the realization that without AWS or Google Cloud it is not possible to correctly implement such functions as track search, charts, etc. And so next-auth is implemented, RestFull api is present and, in principle, the application is technological, as for a pet project.
     
    Unfortunately, it will not be possible to finish the application for technical and political reasons, since most services do not provide the opportunity to use their products in Russia on 02/24/2025.
